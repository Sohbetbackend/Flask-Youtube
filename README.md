Flask YouTube 


I built a YouTube search app in Flask using the YouTube Data API. I used the Python Requests library to call the YouTube Data API, and I used Flask to display the search results.

You need just clone repository and open it in terminal, then you need write pipenv shell and flask run that's all the project will be work))
